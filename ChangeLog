version 0.06: Sun Jul  6 19:44:23 CEST 2003

	Fixes:

	- OODoc::Parser::Markov mutulated ampersants in the HTML output:
          was: & --> \amp;    became:   & --> \&amp;

	- filenames in MANIFEST file made relative to that file

	- make head1 really equivalent to chapter

	- OODoc::Parser::Markov does add blank lines to output POD if
	  the author did not include them around pod statements.  Superfluous
	  blanks are removed.

	Improvements:

	- OODoc::Format::Html copies mode of template file.

	- Included Mail::Box example set-up, which will grow to become
	  the most complicated demonstration of possibilities.

	- Support of L<> in OODoc::Parser::Markov with all features
	  defined by perlpod.

	- $chapter->findEntry looks for chapters, sections, subsections
	  with a certain name: an index entry.

	- Implemented =begin/=end understanding for OODoc/Parser/Markov
	  for both Html as Pod formatters.

	- Implemented =for understanding for OODoc/Parser/Markov
	  for both Html as Pod formatters.

	- Implemented =begin :html and =for :html understanding for
	  OODoc/Parser/Markov, for both Html as Pod formatters.

version 0.05: Tue May  6 12:19:17 CEST 2003

	The Markov parser syntax has not changed, but nearly everything
	else did.

	Improvements:
	- Many improvements in the produced HTML, especially when
	  more than one manual page is produced for a single packages
	  OODoc is now able to produce Mail::Box documentation, which
	  is huge and complex.
	- Added examples/mimetypes.tar.gz as very simple set-up

version 0.04: Thu May  1 13:25:37 CEST 2003

	Improvements:
	- Producing HTML
	- Added examples/oodoc.tar.gz and accompanying files
	- Renamed OODoc::Format::PodTemplate into OODoc::Format::Pod2,
	  because there may be more template based formatters into POD
	  later.
