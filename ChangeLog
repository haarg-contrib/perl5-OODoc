explicitly stated differently.

version 0.09: Tue Sep 30 09:59:06 CEST 2003

	Fixes:

	- Text::MagicTemplate 2.11 destroys the template which is passed
	  to output(), so we need to make a copy first.

version 0.08: Mon Sep  8 17:12:02 CEST 2003

	Fixes:

	- Adapted to Text::MagicTemplate release 2.11, which is not
	  compatible with older versions :-(

	- OODoc::Format::Pod(2) could not format =function
 
	- When the same distribution was created for the second time
	  in a row, some files could be missing from the MANIFEST.

	Improvements:

	- Added Object::Realize::Later to the examples (orl.tar.gz).
	  It can't get any simpler.

	- Added Bundle::Text::MagicTemplate to the pre-requisits

version 0.07: Tue Jul 29 14:06:38 CEST 2003

	Fixes:

	- OODoc::Parser::Markov will add target=_blank to links produced
	  from L<http://>

	- OODoc::Parser::Markov does not change < into &lt; within
	  =for :html and =begin :html

	Improvements:

	- Moved all modules into lib/

	- Added everything what is needed to merge the documentation of
	  multiple modules (especially useful to produce one huge HTML
	  version of related modules)

	- The version for the distribution is automatically taken from
	  a file named version or VERSION in the source directory of the
	  files.

	- L<> links in verbatim for pod is replaced by text, because
	  most podlaters do not know better.

	- The example of OODoc use with MailBox shows how to combine
	  multiple modules into one doc tree.

version 0.06: Sun Jul  6 19:44:23 CEST 2003

	Fixes:

	- OODoc::Parser::Markov mutulated ampersants in the HTML output:
          was: & --> \amp;    became:   & --> \&amp;

	- filenames in MANIFEST file made relative to that file

	- make head1 really equivalent to chapter

	- OODoc::Parser::Markov does add blank lines to output POD if
	  the author did not include them around pod statements.  Superfluous
	  blanks are removed.

	Improvements:

	- OODoc::Format::Html copies mode of template file.

	- Included Mail::Box example set-up, which will grow to become
	  the most complicated demonstration of possibilities.

	- Support of L<> in OODoc::Parser::Markov with all features
	  defined by perlpod.

	- $chapter->findEntry looks for chapters, sections, subsections
	  with a certain name: an index entry.

	- Implemented =begin/=end understanding for OODoc/Parser/Markov
	  for both Html as Pod formatters.

	- Implemented =for understanding for OODoc/Parser/Markov
	  for both Html as Pod formatters.

	- Implemented =begin :html and =for :html understanding for
	  OODoc/Parser/Markov, for both Html as Pod formatters.

	- The example of MailBox is much more complex, now more than
	  one distribution is included into MailBox's html website.

version 0.05: Tue May  6 12:19:17 CEST 2003

	The Markov parser syntax has not changed, but nearly everything
	else did.

	Improvements:
	- Many improvements in the produced HTML, especially when
	  more than one manual page is produced for a single packages
	  OODoc is now able to produce Mail::Box documentation, which
	  is huge and complex.
	- Added examples/mimetypes.tar.gz as very simple set-up

version 0.04: Thu May  1 13:25:37 CEST 2003

	Improvements:
	- Producing HTML
	- Added examples/oodoc.tar.gz and accompanying files
	- Renamed OODoc::Format::PodTemplate into OODoc::Format::Pod2,
	  because there may be more template based formatters into POD
	  later.

version 0.03: Wed Apr  2 14:47:00 CEST 2003

	Improvements:
	- Added OODoc::Format::PodTemplate
	- Minor reorderings in OODoc::Format::Pod

version 0.02: Tue Apr  1 13:52:33 CEST 2003

	Improvements:
	- handling of format_options
	- appending text to POD
	- documentation about POD configuration

version 0.01: March 30, 2003

	Initial implementation
