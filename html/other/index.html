    <p>The OODoc module is designed to create manual pages independent from the
    source of the information and the type of output.  The documentation may
    be extracted from the source code with a parser (like the
    <a href="OODoc::Parser::Markov/">Markov parser</a>,
    which extends the syntax of POD with logical markup) and the output may
    be plain POD or HTML.</p>
    
    <p>OODoc can be extended with new input parsers and output
    formatters in an Object Oriented way.  OODoc supports features to
    improve the documentation of Object Oriented modules.</p>

    <dd>A list of all diagnostics which can be produced by this module.  Often

    <dd>Many manual pages contain a DETAILS chapter which explains all
        kinds of facts about the general background, implementation
        specifics, and examples of complex use of the items.
         Looking through the full
        list of details may help to find a solution.

    <h2>Example</h2>

    <p>This website is a demonstration of the output of the
    M<OODoc::Format::Html> formatter, which uses templates to describe
    the pages.  The whole set-up is included in the module as example.
    Other (simpler) examples will be included in the future.</p>

    <h2>Warning</h2>

    <p>The module is still quite young and therefore due for rapid
    change.  The common structure will stand, but the capabilities
    will grow fast.  This may mean that you want to adapt to each
    next release of the module, which will cost you some time for
    each release.  I will do my best to be backwards compatible.</p>
